# FitzHugh-Nagumo-Model-for-neurons
The impulses in neuron were modelled by FitzHugh and Nagumo independently, as a parabolic non-linear partial differential equation. This equation is solved and the solution is plotted using MATLAB when an initial sinusoidal impulse is given at t=0.
The algorithm used is BTCS(Backward in Time Central in Space).
